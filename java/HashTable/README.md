# Challenge Summary 30
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects.

### API

1. add()
- Arguments: key, value
- Returns: nothing
- This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

2. get()
- Arguments: key
- Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
- contains()

3. Arguments: key
- Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

4.  hash()
- Arguments: key
- Returns: Index in the collection for that key

# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

- Write a function called left join
- Arguments: two hash maps
1. The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
2. The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
- Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
